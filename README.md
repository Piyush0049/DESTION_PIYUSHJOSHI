# My Project

## Overview

This project is a submission for the assignment given by **Destion**. It showcases a modern frontend design website built using **Vite**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The application includes three primary pages: **Login**, **Signup**, and **Dashboard**.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts beautifully to different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Interactive Charts**: Utilizes Chart.js for visual data representation in the dashboard.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Tailwind CSS is leveraged for creating a visually appealing and modern design.

## Pages Included
